# Experiments dir

Please save here all the consolidated data from your experiments that you need to make persistent.

##Â Example
The distribution comes with an example file coming from a simulation, that will be later used by the example notebook.
```
data_Grid_160926_124432.csv
```
It contains data coming from a traffic simulation experiment as a CSV format (command separated values).
Any other format is accepted, as the directory is used for experiments persistency.
