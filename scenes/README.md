# Scenes dir

Please include here any information relatied to the different scenarios that you can use in your experiments with input data.

There is a subtle difference between the *scenes* and the *experiments* directories:
* The *scenes* dir contains input data.
* The *experiments* dir contains output data related to the execution of one of the preceding escenarios.

Please note that a scenario can be executed and repeated many times.
