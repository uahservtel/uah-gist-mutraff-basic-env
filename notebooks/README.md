# Notebooks dir

Here you will add your scientific research notebooks (files .ipynb) coming from Conda / Anaconda / iPython.

## Example:
We provide you an example Notebook that loads data coming from and experiment (in the persistent side), and makes some transformation with them, to finally create some representation.
Feel free to open it and play.
